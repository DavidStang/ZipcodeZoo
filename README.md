Plant Finder
Use Plant Finder to find one or more plants that match some set of characteristics of interest. PlantFinder's database currently includes 2,636,218 attributes for 266,490 of the 1,423,693 plants on this site. Search on any combination of 21 criteria, including appearance (habit, bloom period, etc.), leaf morphology (shape, venation, margin), growth factors (hardiness zones, sunlight, etc.), and various special qualities (deer-resistant, smog-tolerant, etc.) You might use it to find a plant for your garden, or to help identify a plant you have seen.

Bird Finder
Use Bird Finder to find one or more birds that match some set of visual characteristics of interest. BirdFinder's database currently includes 102,204 attributes for 4,753 of the 59,334 birds on this site. Narrow your results by defining characteristics of flight (flight pattern, wing beat rate, wing beat rate variability, stroke length), the color, and likelihood of being encountered at any location in North America.

Butterfly Finder
Find butterflies and moths by proximity, family, colors, life stage, and orientation. Narrow your search by choosing just one family of butterflies and moths, and/or by color (and even top/bottom/side where that color might be found) and/or life stage -- egg, caterpillar, pupa, or adult. Optionally include proximity and your results will be ordered by your chance of finding them near you. ButterflyFinder's database currently includes lookup info and photos for 2,308 different butterflies, skippers, and moths of the 271,314 on this site.

Proximity Finder
List plants or animals most likely to be found near any location on earth. Choose from a category list (such as plants, animals, amphibians, birds, bony fish, mammals, insects) or from any phylum, class, order or family. Results are order by probabilty of finding species within the selected category near you (or the location you've designated).

Regional Finder
List plants or animals most likely to be found in any country or any U.S. state or Canadian province. Choose from a category list (such as plants, animals, amphibians...) or from any phylum, class, order or family. Results are order by probabilty of finding species within the selected category near you (or the location you've designated).

The AudiOh® Sound Encyclopedia
The AudiOh Sound Encyclopedia offers 214,907 sounds and sonograms for 17,725 birds. You may select a bird of interest by scientific name or by English/French/German/Italian/Spanish common name. View or hide distribution maps, photos, and information on color, diet, and reproduction. Then play from a list of calls and songs. You may play two or more recordings at once, a trick which will hasten your learning of this bird's sound.

The AudiOh® Local Sound Trainer
The AudiOh Local Sound Trainer provides up to five sample recordings for the most common birds near any location in the world. The Local Sound Trainer will guess your location (you can change this), and provide you with sounds and sonograms of those birds that are most common where you are. You can narrow your search to birds of any family, found at any distance. To do this, we examine our database of 249,201,562 field observations, and determine how many are found near you. We then sort that list, and provide sounds and sonograms on the top birds in your area, drawing on our database of 214,907 sounds and sonograms for 17,725 of the 59,334 birds on this site.

Life List
Track what you've seen with LifeList, our free database tool. LifeList works with our other apps and pages, to make it as easy as possible for you to record what you've seen, and later review and edit it.

Coordinates Check
Find your approximate latitude and longitude for any U.S. city or any zipcode. Optionally use these coordinates when using proximity as a search criterion in another lookup.
